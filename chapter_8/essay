A conference marking the 80th anniversary of Taiwan's restoration was held in Beijing on Saturday, with China's top political advisor Wang Huning calling on Chinese people at home and abroad to unite more broadly, recall history and safeguard the achievements of the victory in the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War.

Wang, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), noted that both the victory of the war and the restoration of Taiwan were great triumphs for the entire Chinese nation â€“ a shared glory of the Chinese people.

The establishment of the Commemoration Day of Taiwan's Restoration demonstrates the firm resolve of all ethnic groups in China to uphold the one-China principle and defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity, Wang said.

It reflects the shared aspiration of all Chinese people, including those in Taiwan and overseas compatriots, and embodies the unwavering commitment of the Communist Party of China to fulfilling its historic mission and realizing the complete reunification of the motherland. It also reinforces the broad international consensus that there is only one China in the world and that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, he added.
